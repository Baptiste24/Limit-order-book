# Limit-order-book
Use Python to construct a limit order book and simulate the dynamic trading process

We will generate 5000 random orders that can be limit orders or market orders.
The limit order book will be updated based on incoming order
Lastly we export the bid-ask spread to txt files and xlsx file.
